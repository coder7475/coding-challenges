# Build Your Own wc Tool

This is my implementation of the `wc` command line tool, based on the coding challenge from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc).

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a clone of the Unix command line tool `wc`. This tool is used to count words, lines, characters, and bytes in text files.

## Development Plan

1. Implement basic file reading functionality

3. Add word counting feature
4. Add character counting feature
5. Add byte counting feature
6. Handle multiple file inputs
7. Add command line argument parsing
8. Write tests
9. Add error handling
